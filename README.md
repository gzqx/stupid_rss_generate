# Stupid Rss Generator
This is a stupid perl script that generates a RSS XML file that you can subscribe to with your RSS reader.

## Why
Mainly because I want to be able to subscribe to serial books. As we all know, RSS is dying since it is hard to harvest data from RSS users.

## How
- `make` and `make install`.

## And 
- I don't use windows or osX. Perl should work on them but I am not sure.

## TODO
- countless todos in the code
- proper cli interface
